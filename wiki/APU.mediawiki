The [[MCPX]] contains an APU (Audio Processing Unit).

* SSL = Stream Segment List
* SGE = Scatter Gather Entry
* PRD = Physical Resource Descriptor (Same thing as SGE?!)

== Global Processor (GP) ==

* GPS = GP Scratch (?)
* GPF = GP FIFO

== Encode Processor (EP) ==

The EP encodes the final AC3 stream for SPDIF. {{FIXME|reason=It might do more than just that; what does it do in analog mode for example?}}
It is not used during the [[Boot Animation]].

* EPS = EP Scratch (?)
* EPF = EP FIFO

== Voice Processor (VP) ==

A powerful voice processor. There can be up to 256 voices{{citation needed}} and 64{{citation needed}} of those can be 3D.

Per-voice settings:
* [[wikipedia:Head-related transfer function|Head-related transfer function]]
* [[wikipedia:Low-frequency oscillation|Low-frequency oscillation]]
* Pitch
* Input type (8bit, 16bit, 24bit, ADPCM)
* Volume envelope
* 8 target bins, each with a custom volume for this voice

There are 32 bins which these voices will be mixed into.

=== Memory sections ===

* VPV = VP Voices
* VPHT = VP HRTF Target
* VPHC = VP HRTF Current
* VPSGE = VP SGEs
* VPSSL = VP SSLs

=== Voice lists ===

The voices are kept in a single-linked list. There are 3 voice lists:

* 2D
* 3D
* MP (Multipass?)

=== Voice structure ===

This is 0x80 bytes

==== Pitch calculation ====

The 16 bit signed pitch value (''p'') can be converted to and from a unsigned frequency in Hz (''f'') using the following formulas:

<pre>
p = 4096 * log2(f / 48000)
f = pow2(p / 4096) * 48000
</pre>
