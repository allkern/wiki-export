|This was originally going to be a commercial emulator (but plans were dropped quickly in favor of preservation). The source code was temporarily public but then made private. The source code is still available to a selected group of developers. Hackbox was designed from scratch but re-used code from Cxbx for HLE routine detection.

|Proprietary
|Announced at E3 2017. Said to be working similar to the 360 support in the Xbox One [https://youtu.be/x0NKP7-h_G0?t=8503]. The 360 support is probably ahead of time shader translation and runtime CPU translation [https://majornelson.com/podcast/584-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-turns-1/].
