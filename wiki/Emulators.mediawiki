|Private
|This was originally going to be a commercial emulator (but plans were dropped quickly in favor of preservation). The source code was temporarily public but then made private. The source code is still available to a selected group of developers. Hackbox was designed from scratch but re-used code from Cxbx for HLE routine detection.
