The MCPX is the southbridge chip of the Xbox chipset by Nvidia. It
contains the sound processors ([APU](/wiki/APU "wikilink") and
[ACI](/wiki/ACI "wikilink")) and also the USB, PCI, IDE, etc,
controllers[1](https://web.archive.org/web/20010418214256/http://www.ga-hardware.com:80/preview.cfm?id=NVIDIAMCP),

The MCPX is also the home to the secret [MCPX ROM](/wiki/MCPX_ROM "wikilink").

And it's also the home of the famous PC Speaker Signal.  
One just has to solder a Speaker on (MXPC pin L21) and it can be used
just like on the PC.
