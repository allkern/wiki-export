The 16 byte RC4 key used to decrypt parts of the [[EEPROM]].

The key is passed to kernel from from 2BL.
It is only initialized on cold-boot.

If an XBE is loaded which is not allowed to run in the manufacturing region, the Microsoft Kernels will set the EEPROM key to all zeros.
As the key is not re-initialized, this means running the first non-manufacturing XBE (such as a game or [[Dashboard]]{{FIXME|reason=confirm the dash is not running in manufacturing}}), will make the key unretrievable until a reboot.
