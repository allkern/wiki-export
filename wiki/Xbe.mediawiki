{{DISPLAYTITLE:XBE}}
XBE files (XBox Executable) are the main files that are executed in the Xbox System. In official games, these files are created by game developers, and then signed by Microsoft.

=== Title ID ===

A title ID is usually 2 ASCII letters for the publisher, followed by a u16 integer (Above 2000 for non-original Xbox games)

{| class=wikitable
! Publisher ID !! Name
|-
| MS || Microsoft
|-
| EA || EA
|}

The title ID seems to double the information from the [[Xbox Game Disc]] mastering code etched into the ring or readable from the DMI.
It is expressed in 3 decimal digits here which suggests that the title ID integer will always be below 1000.

'''Examples''':

FIFA 2003:
* DMI and mastering code: EA02302E (Meaning: publisher EA, game number 023, version 02, region Europe)
* Title ID: 

Halo (1.02):
* DMI and mastering code: MS00402A (Meaning: publisher Microsoft, game number 004, version 02, region America)
* Title ID: 4D530004 [MS-004]

Halo (1.04):
* DMI and mastering code: MS00404E (Meaning: publisher Microsoft, game number 004, version 04, region Europe)
