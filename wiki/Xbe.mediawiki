The title ID seems to double the information from the [[Xbox Game Disc]] mastering code etched into the ring or readable from the DMI.
The game number is expressed in 3 decimal digits here which suggests that it will always be below 1000.

'''Examples''':

[[FIFA Soccer 2003]]:
* DMI and mastering code: EA02302E (Meaning: publisher EA, game number 023, version 02, region Europe)
* Title ID: {{FIXME}}

[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]:
* DMI and mastering code: MS00402A (Meaning: publisher Microsoft, game number 004, version 02, region America)
* Title ID: 4D530004 [MS-004]

[[Halo: Combat Evolved]]:
* DMI and mastering code: MS00404E (Meaning: publisher Microsoft, game number 004, version 04, region Europe)
* Title ID: 4D530004 [MS-004]

=== Sections ===

=== .text ===

The .text section contains all x86 subroutines to be executed by the [[CPU|processor]].

=== .rdata ===

The .rdata section contains the [[Kernel|kernel thunk table]]. The ordinals in the table are to be resolved to the kernel's actual calling routine, when loaded.
