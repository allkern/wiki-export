=== Xbox related commands ===

==== Enable Unlock 1 (xtreme) state ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>FF 08 01 01</pre>

Enable Unlock 1 (xtreme) state' as we already know it from the 360 xtreme modded drives. 
This command is supported for legacy reasons only. Custom applications should use the new 'Set Lock State' instead.

==== Set Lock State ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>FF 08 01 11 xx</pre>

* <code>xx=00</code> - Drive locked (no unlock state)
* <code>xx=01</code> - Unlock State 1 (xtreme) enabled
* <code>xx=02</code> - Unlock state 2 (wxripper) enabled

==== SS extract command ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>AD 00 FF 02 FD FF FE 00 08 00 xx C0</pre>

This is the well known  from the xtreme firmware.

==== Get Feature List ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>FF 08 01 10</pre>

This command will return a list of the additional features supported by the drive.
All values returned are 16 bit values, and the list is terminated with null (<code>0x0000</code>).
The two first words of the returned list always reads as <code>0xA55A 0X5AA5</code> in order to guarantee that a reply from a drive not supporting this command correctly isn't mistaken for a feature list.

An example feature list could be: <code>0xA55A, 0x5AA5, 0x0100, 0xF000, 0xF001, 0x0000</code>

This list would indicate that the drive supports XBOX360 Unlock 1, Lock and Error Skip, as it can be seen from the values defined below:

XBOX 360 related features:

* <code>0x0100</code> : The drive supports the unlock 1 state (xtreme)
* <code>0x0101</code> : The drive supports the unlock 2 state (wxripper)
* <code>0x0120</code> : The drive can read and decrypt the SS
* <code>0x0121</code> : The drive has full challenge response functionality

XBOX related features:

* <code>0x0200</code> : The drive supports the unlock 1 state (xtreme)
* <code>0x0201</code> : The drive supports the unlock 2 state (wxripper)
* <code>0x0220</code> : The drive can read and decrypt the SS
* <code>0x0221</code> : The drive has full challenge response functionality

General drive features:

* <code>0xF000</code> : The drive supports the lock (cancel any unlock state) command
* <code>0xF001</code> : The drive supports error skipping

This is the complete list of defined features at the moment. If you're working on a custom application you might want to contact me in order to get the latest list.
