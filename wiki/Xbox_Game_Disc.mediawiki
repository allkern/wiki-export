Xbox games are shipped on DVDs. They are commonly referred to as Xbox Game Discs (XGD).

== Visible information on ring ==

'''The DVD inner ring usually contains:'''

(The examples are from a German [[FIFA Soccer 2003]] disc)

An outer portion with labels:
* Outer ring Layer 1
** Code 39 Barcode of the the Mastering Code (*EA02302E L1*)
** Text for Mastering code ("EA02302E L1 02 0MM", where "02" is a smaller font and slightly higher than the previous baseline, followed by "0MM" on the original baseline)
** Mastering SID Code ("IFPI L126")
* Inner ring for Layer 0
** Code 39 Barcode of the the Mastering Code (*EA02302E L0*)
** Text for Mastering code ("EA02302E L0 06", where "06" is a smaller font and slightly higher than the previous baseline)
** Mastering SID Code ("IFPI L126")

An inner porition with Xbox logo:
* 3 times "XBOX" text with "X Logo" in the background on each side
* 1 time "XBOX" text with blank background
* 3 times "XBOX" text with "X Logo" in the background on each side
* Another tiny pattern segmented into 7 portions in alternating position,(opposite of the "XBOX" text without logo)
** 4 times a Xbox logo 
** 2 times the word "genuine"
** and in the middle the word ASPnnnn where n is a number{{citation needed}} 

''' ASP code '''
[[File:Asp demodisk.jpg|thumb|right|Detail of the DVD hologram, reflecting the ASP5080 by the flash of the camera. found on a demodisk (IM00113E-IM)]]
The following table lists known ASPnnnn numbers found on Xbox dvd disks, they are also on 360 disks but we dont list those in this wiki.
The games listed are examples, its known for sure more disks can have these numbers and further research can be done, to determine the meaning.
It is rumoured it might be a version string of some sorts slowly raising in xbox years old. {{citation needed}}

===== Decryption of challenge entries =====

Starting at offset 1183, a 44 byte SHA-1 hash is generated.
The first 7 byte of the resulting hash are used as the key in RC4 decryption. The 253 Bytes of the challenge entries (Offset 770) will be decrypted.

There'll only be a handful of valid entries in the challenge entries.
However there'll be at least 2.

=== Dumping ===

=== Xbox related commands ===

==== Enable Unlock 1 (xtreme) state ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>FF 08 01 01</pre>

Enable Unlock 1 (xtreme) state' as we already know it from the 360 xtreme modded drives. 
This command is supported for legacy reasons only. Custom applications should use the new 'Set Lock State' instead.

==== Set Lock State ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>FF 08 01 11 xx</pre>

* <code>xx=00</code> - Drive locked (no unlock state)
* <code>xx=01</code> - Unlock State 1 (xtreme) enabled
* <code>xx=02</code> - Unlock state 2 (wxripper) enabled

==== SS extract command ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>AD 00 FF 02 FD FF FE 00 08 00 xx C0</pre>

This is the well known  from the xtreme firmware.

==== Get Feature List ====

Supported by: Kreon 1.00
<pre>FF 08 01 10</pre>

This command will return a list of the additional features supported by the drive.
All values returned are 16 bit values, and the list is terminated with null (<code>0x0000</code>).
The two first words of the returned list always reads as <code>0xA55A 0X5AA5</code> in order to guarantee that a reply from a drive not supporting this command correctly isn't mistaken for a feature list.

An example feature list could be: <code>0xA55A, 0x5AA5, 0x0100, 0xF000, 0xF001, 0x0000</code>

This list would indicate that the drive supports XBOX360 Unlock 1, Lock and Error Skip, as it can be seen from the values defined below:

XBOX 360 related features:

* <code>0x0100</code> : The drive supports the unlock 1 state (xtreme)
* <code>0x0101</code> : The drive supports the unlock 2 state (wxripper)
* <code>0x0120</code> : The drive can read and decrypt the SS
* <code>0x0121</code> : The drive has full challenge response functionality

XBOX related features:

* <code>0x0200</code> : The drive supports the unlock 1 state (xtreme)
* <code>0x0201</code> : The drive supports the unlock 2 state (wxripper)
* <code>0x0220</code> : The drive can read and decrypt the SS
* <code>0x0221</code> : The drive has full challenge response functionality

General drive features:

* <code>0xF000</code> : The drive supports the lock (cancel any unlock state) command
* <code>0xF001</code> : The drive supports error skipping

This is the complete list of defined features at the moment. If you're working on a custom application you might want to contact me in order to get the latest list.
