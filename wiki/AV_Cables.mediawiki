Microsoft has released a handful of '''Audio Video Cables''' for the [[Xbox]], which they refer to internally as '''AV Packs'''. They are connected to the port labelled "Audio Video Input/Output" on the backside of the console.

== Connector ==

{{FIXME|reason=Describe the connector here - is it a standard part? add an image, add the pinout graphics (didn't copy from elsewhere because clearly microsoft copyright)}}

=== Pinout ===
The following table gives the pinout in the way it is arranged on the '''XBOX AVIP''' cables, or '''AV Packs'''. The other end is reversed and on the console.

== Supported signals / AV cables ==

Below is a table which lists all known officially '''AV cables''' released by Microsoft and their respective signal.
The constants used in the av-prefixed Kernel-functions are also listed.

A signal value of 0 means connection to ground (Pins 7, 6, 5), whereas a value of 1 means an open-connection{{citation needed|reason=Are these still connected to Vcc maybe?}}

The region only identifies which territory the cable was originally available / intended for. The kernel still might support other video-standards (NTSC / PAL / SECAM) using the same cable.

{{FIXME|reason=Add a list of AV cables with pictures and their supported video modes using the official kernel}}
