There are 7{{citation needed|reason=What about debug kits? mcpx revisions? RAM changes? .. should we even try to count?}}retail Xbox revisions

== 1.0 ==

* Made in Hungary
* USB controller is on a separate PCB
* GPU has a fan on the heat sink
* MCPX 1.0 ROM
* Thomson DVD Drive
* Seagate Hard Drive
* Conexant [[Video Encoder]]

== 1.1 ==

Same as 1.0, except:
* Made in Hungary or Mexico
* USB controller moved onto the motherboard
* Fan removed from the GPU heat sink
* MCPX 1.1 ROM

Microsoft later switched to lower quality Hynix RAM.
These Xboxes with non-Samsung RAM are sometimes referred to as 1.6b by the modding community.

== Identifying ==

While not definitive, here are some ways to help identify the revision of your Xbox.

=== Manufacturing Details ===

{| class="wikitable"
! scope="col" | Date Range
! scope="col" | Revision
! scope="col" | Location
|-
| 01/2001-10/2002 || 1.0 || Hungary
|-
| 11/2002-04/2003 || 1.1 || Hungary, Mexico
|-
| 05/2003-03/2004 || 1.2 || China
|-
| 04/2004 Onward || 1.6 || China, Taiwan
|}

=== Serial Number ===

The serial number looks like this:

LNNNNNN YWWFF

* L is the production line
* NNNNNN is the number produced that week
* Y is the last digit of the production year
* WW is the number of the week
* FF is the factory code

Note, this table contradicts the previous table.
