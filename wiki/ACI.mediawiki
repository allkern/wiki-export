The ACI of the Xbox provides AC97.
It's similar to the AMD-768 ACI, but it is accessed through MMIO instead. The datasheet for the AMD-768 can be found at https://web.archive.org/web/20060322081039/http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/24467.pdf .

The AC97 implementation only supports playback of 16-bit PCM stereo samples at 48kHz{{FIXME|reason=Not confirmed, but very likely}}.

== Register addresses ==

* 0x110 PCM
* 0x170 SPDIF

== Usage in DirectSound ==

AC97 is only used to receive buffers from the [[APU]].
{{FIXME|reason=I know more about this, but too lazy to write it down; JayFoxRox}}
