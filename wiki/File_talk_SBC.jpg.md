Minor complaints
----------------

Cool image, just some minor complaints which can potentially be fixed in
the future:

-   <s>Image not cropped / centered</s>
-   <s>Comment should say where this file originated (I assume a manual
    scan?)</s>
-   <s>Bottom of image is cut-off</s>
-   <s>Small vertical seam near center</s>
-   <s>Different font for “Override”, why?</s>

Upgraded.

The font is probably due to a bug in the original manual. I have a
different version of the manual where this text says “OVER DRIVE”. The
font in the fixed manual where it says “OVERRIDE” is also weird. So they
probably just drew over the original with whatever font they had.
