Minor complaints
----------------

Cool image, just some minor complaints which can potentially be fixed in
the future:

-   Image not cropped / centered
-   Comment should say where this file originated (I assume a manual
    scan?)
-   Bottom of image is cut-off
-   Small vertical seam near center
-   Different font for “Override”, why?
