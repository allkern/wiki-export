The DSPs in the APU are probably "Parthus MediaStream" DSP core (DSP24210/DSP2420?).

Those are similar to Motorola DSP56362 (DSP56300 Family). If so, the datasheet can be found at http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/DSP56362.pdf (Also see "Documentation" section in said datasheet for the related documentation)

''This section is very incomplete and not much was tested on hardware either''

Sample formats:

* 0x0 = 8 bit
* 0x1 = 16 bit
* 0x2 = 24 bit in MSB
* 0x3 = 32 bit
* 0x4
* 0x5
* 0x6 = 24 bit in LSB (also endianess switched?{{citation needed}})
* 0x7

Buffers:

* 0x0 = FIFO0
* 0x1 = FIFO1
* 0x2 = FIFO2{{citation needed}}
* 0x3 = FIFO3{{citation needed}}
