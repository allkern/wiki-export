The MCPX is the southbridge chip of the Xbox chipset by Nvidia. It contains the sound processors ([[APU]] and [[ACI]]) and also the USB, PCI, IDE, etc, controllers[https://web.archive.org/web/20010418214256/http://www.ga-hardware.com:80/preview.cfm?id=NVIDIAMCP], [https://web.archive.org/web/20010410003338/http://www.nvnews.net/previews/mcpx/mcpx.shtml].

=== ROM ===

The MCPX is home to the secret [[MCPX ROM]].

=== Pin L21: PC Speaker ===

The MCPX has PC Speaker pin which can be controlled using [the standard PC Speaker interface https://wiki.osdev.org/PC_Speaker].
However, no actual speaker is connected to the pin, so while the signal exists, there will be no audible sound on a stock Xbox.

A speaker can be soldered to this pin and to make the signal audible [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te4MSskbBEE][https://github.com/0DaveX/beep/]

The original Microsoft code does not drive the PC Speaker at all, so this otherwise unused pin can also be used for inaudible forms of unidirectional communication.
