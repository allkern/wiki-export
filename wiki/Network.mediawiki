The Xbox contains an Ethernet module and one RJ45 connector. Additionally, separate modem and wireless accessories were considered when developing the console. Eventualy an official wireless adapter was released based of a "D-Link 108AG Gaming Adapter" in the end of 2003.

The Xbox has a TCP/IP protocol stack complete with a DNS PPTP, DHCP clients. 

Port 3074 UDP/TCP is reserved for Xbox communications.

== Hardware ==

Integrated in the Nvidia Southbridge MCPX chip which is similar to the nForce chips. The Xbox Linux team used the binary drivers from Nvidia.

=== Wireless adapter ===

based on the "D-Link 108AG Gaming Adapter", the Xbox MN-740 Wireless Bridge bundled with a Xbox setup disc (wich would update the dashboard if necessary).

==== Hardware ====

* AR5312 CPU (MIPS 4Kc core?{{citation needed}}) 
* AR5212 RoC (Radio on Chip){{citation needed}} for 2.4 Ghz 802.11b/g{{citation needed}}. 
* KS8721B physical layer transciever
* some Eeprom wich hold the MAC adress (based of FCC pictures and Firmware analysis){{citation needed}} 
* IC42S16400 8Mb ram
* SST39LF0?0A (1 or 2 Mb) (the FCC picture is unclear on the size part due to writing) {{citation needed}} 

The onboard 3 leds are: Power, Wireless and Xbox(called Ethernet on the PCB).
The board seems to have Jtag and what apears to be Serial testpins exposed. 

===== Firmware =====

This wireless bridge runs a closed source version of the"ThreadX JADE/Green Hills Version G4.0.4.0" RTOS. 
The firmware contains a copyright string of: "Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation All Rights Reserved Device is Xbox Compatible"

latest firmware is seperated by a boot and runtime firmware {{citation needed}} : 
* MN740_01.03.00.0005_BOOT.bin, "Xbox Wireless Adapter (MN-740) boot firmware"
* MN740_01.00.02.0022_RUNTIME.bin, "Xbox Wireless Adapter (MN-740) runtime firmware"

====== WPA2 support ======

The shipped firmware does not support WPA or WPA2.
A "firmware" hack based on the D-Link firmware adds WPA support, rendering Dashboard support unfunctional and changing settings require connecting to the LAN port using a PC (or webbrowser capable application).

==== Software (Xbox setup disc) ====

The setup disc is a CD[http://redump.org/disc/53586/]. It contains an XISO filesystem that contains only a "default.xbe" which contains a dashboard updater.
