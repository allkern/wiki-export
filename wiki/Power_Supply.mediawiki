It's either a Foxlink{{citation needed}} or Delta Electronics power supply.

On a 1.0 xbox supply, there seems to be 2{{citation needed|reason=2 per region, or 2 overall?}} types for the US 120V and EU 240V market.

The marks are on the PCB with a check next to them:
* Delta Electronics DPSN-96-AP-1 should be the EU 240V one{{citation needed}}
* Delta Electronics DPSN-96-AP is the US 120V one

There is a link J11 under CR1 (right side of the coil under it) that might make the difference between 120V and 240V.
It also seems that the Bridge rectifier is bigger on the US models.
This could make sense as it has to handle double the current. So, before experimenting with this it might be worth to check if the installed type can handle 2.3 amps.

The rated output currents are also noted on the PCB

* 3V3 Standby  0.075A
* 3V3  4.8A
* 5V   13.2A
* 12V  1.2A

The standby voltage powers the [[SMC]] which handles turning on and off the system.
The Xbox supply needs a voltage (3V3?) on it's power-on line to leave the standby mode.
This results in the other voltages being supplied.
