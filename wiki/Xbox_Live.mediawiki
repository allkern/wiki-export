== Xbox Live ==

Xbox Live is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service created and operated by Microsoft. It was first made available to the Xbox system in November 2002. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live Wikipedia]) Xbox Live support for the original Xbox ended in April 15, 2010. 

The Xbox Live architecture consists of authentication servers, matchmaking servers, and game servers.

=== Authentication servers ===

Authentication and access to Xbox Live services is controlled using the Kerberos protocol with a few proprietary customizations for the Xbox.
