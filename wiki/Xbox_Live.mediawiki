Xbox Live is an online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery service created and operated by Microsoft. It was first made available to the Xbox system in November 2002. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Live Wikipedia]) Xbox Live support for the original Xbox ended in April 15, 2010. 

The Xbox Live architecture consists of authentication servers, matchmaking servers, and game servers.

=== Authentication servers ===

Authentication and access to Xbox Live services is controlled using the Kerberos protocol with a few proprietary customizations for the Xbox.

== Discontinuation of service ==

The service was officially discontinued on April 15th, 2010.

12 players decided to stay in a lobby of ''Halo 2'' 24/7 to keep a server running.
The final player, Apache N4SIR was streaming the entire event, as the player count of 12 twindeled down to just him. At 11:40 PM PDT, on May 11th 2010, Apache N4SIR was booted from the game[http://i.imgur.com/oQw6k5H.jpg].
