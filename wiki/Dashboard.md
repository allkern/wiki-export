### Hotkey to switch to HD modes

Latest Xbox Dashboard (5960) force 480p display mode:

Press and hold Left trigger, right trigger, and both analog stick
buttons.

The normally displayed 480i dashboard will switch to 480p output while
using the Xbox High Definition AV Pack or cable.

Repeat button combo to toggle between 480p and 480i.

### Music visualization in fullscreen

Press “Y” then “X” while playing audio CDs or soundtracks stored on the
HDD to display full-screen geiss-like music visualization. Or, press
Info button on the DVD Playback Kit remote.

But, wait there's more (only visible with DVD Playback Kit and Remote).

Fullscreen Visualization Part 2:

1.  Start playing a song using either the Xbox controller or playback
    kit remote.
2.  Press “Y” then “X” on the controller or “INFO” on the remote to get
    the full screen visualization.
3.  Here's the part that requires the DVD Playback Kit remote. Press
    “STOP” or “PAUSE” (you cannot use the controller to stop the music
    to see it as doing so goes back to the Music Playback menu with the
    small visualization area). Once the music visualization pattern dies
    down, a full-screen swirling starfield pattern appears. After some
    time passes, the screen will be filled with a changing burst of
    solid color where you can make out the wireframe spinning globe seen
    encompassing the main dashboard background. The burst of color fades
    to black leaving the swirling starfield. The cycle repeats with a
    random changing solid color burst which fades to the swirling
    starfield.

Not quite true about needing the remote control, if playing a CD while
full screen visualization is displayed, press the eject button on the
front of the Xbox console.

### Soundtrack name Easter-Egg (“&lt;<Eggs&beta;ox>&gt;”)

    tracks of the CD to the hard drive.

4.  Choose “New Soundtrack” as the destination for your selection.
5.  Enter the name of your soundtrack exactly as follows:
    &lt;<Eggs&beta;ox>&gt; including the less than, beta, and greater
    than symbols.
6.  After you have entered the title, select “Done”. A “Thank You”
    message starts which is followed by a scrolling list of the Xbox
    Team members.

If you press a button on the controller or let the message play through
to the end -- the Xbox reboots.

number and verify registration of your Xbox before giving you a code to
clear/format your fouled Xbox's HDD.
