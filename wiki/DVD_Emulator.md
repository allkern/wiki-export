The DVD emulator is a feature of [Development
Kits](/wiki/Development_Kits "wikilink"). It enables a developer to create and
test for DVD remastering. This means deciding which files to store on
the DVD and where on the disk to store them (layout). this is then
tested using the DVD emulator software, and hardware for loading speeds
and possibly potential faults that could occur.

The Hardware required for this was a Developement kit, (with the DVD
emulation board) some sort of scsi cable, and an XDK-Raptor card. The
complete kit, a Raptor PCI Scsi card and Hardisk was numbered: 940-75004
Rev.01 two or more versions of the PCI scsi card are known:

-   700-75307 Rev.01
-   700-75307 Rev 03
    [Assemblergames](https://assemblergames.com/threads/sealed-xbox-raptor-card-for-xdk-dvd-emu.41763/)(posibly
    same as rev1?)

The software was bundled with the official xdk software and a (40GB
?)Hardisk was connected to the Raptorcard where the DVD mastering image
was stored on. This wasn't the fastest way to get an executable to the
Xbox for development, and is useless for Homebrew.
