Note: Info in above table comes from XKUtils
[XKEEPROM.h](https://svn.exotica.org.uk:8443/xbmc4xbox/tags/3.5.3/xbmc/xbox/XKEEPROM.h).

<sup>\*</sup>Configmagic-FINAL-1.6 uses the wrong size when computing
Checksum2 (40 instead of 44 bytes) and Checksum3 (96 instead of 92
bytes). Checksum2 value computed was correct only because the extra 4
bytes not used in the CRC computation were all 0's which does not change
the CRC value. However, a similiar problem with computation of Checksum3
is present. The CRC computed for v1.6 Xbox's is incorrect as the 4 extra
bytes are not 0's as on earlier versions.

Reading/Writing the EEPROM
--------------------------

### Software Method

This is the easiest way to dump an Xbox EEPROM. Use your alternative
dashboard to dump the EEPROM to a file and download it over FTP.

### Hardware Method

If you cannot dump the EEPROM using software, you can dump it using
hardware. You have several options: use an I2C host adapter (see
[here](http://dangerousprototypes.com/blog/bus-pirate-manual/) or
[here](https://www.totalphase.com/products/aardvark-i2cspi/)), build an
[I2C-Serial cable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcK6nKyKGVQ), or use
a device like a RaspberryPi which has an I2C interface. Connect
SDA/SCL/ground to the LPC pinout on the board. See
[here](https://github.com/grimdoomer/PiPROM) for pinout information.
Then use the corresponding software to read/write the EEPROM.

The HMAC HDD Key
----------------

The HMAC HDD Key is generated out of the first 48 bytes. This section
has been identified clearly.

The Region Code
---------------

This DWORD is encrypted. It corresponds to the region code in the XBE
header:

|            |                     |
|------------|---------------------|
| 0x00000001 | North America       |
| 0x00000002 | Japan               |
| 0x00000004 | Europe / Australia  |
| 0x80000000 | Manufacturing plant |

The MAC address
---------------

This is the MAC address of the Ethernet hardware, which has been [issued
by the
IEEE](https://web.archive.org/web/20100617020733/http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui_public.txt).

DVD Region
----------

This DWORD corresponds to the region code for playback of DVD movies:

|            |          |
|------------|----------|
| 0x00000000 | None     |
| 0x00000001 | Region 1 |
| ...        | ...      |
| 0x00000006 | Region 6 |

Checksum Algorithm
------------------

Checksum2 and Checksum3 values can be calculated by running the
following code snippet over the area the checksum covers:

     /* The EepromCRC algorithm was obtained from the XKUtils 0.2 source released by
      * TeamAssembly under the GNU GPL.
      * Specifically, from XKCRC.cpp
      *
      * Rewritten to ANSI C by David Pye (dmp@davidmpye.dyndns.org)
      *
      * Thanks! */
     void EepromCRC(unsigned char *crc, unsigned char *data, long dataLen) {
             unsigned char* CRC_Data = (unsigned char *)malloc(dataLen+4);
             int pos=0;
             memset(crc,0x00,4);
     
             memset(CRC_Data,0x00, dataLen+4);
             //Circle shift input data one byte right
             memcpy(CRC_Data + 0x01 , data, dataLen-1);
             memcpy(CRC_Data, data + dataLen-1, 0x01);
     
             for (pos=0; pos&lt;4; ++pos) {
                     unsigned short CRCPosVal = 0xFFFF;
                     unsigned long l;
                     for (l=pos; l&lt;dataLen; l+=4) {
                             CRCPosVal -= *(unsigned short*)(&amp;CRC_Data[l]);
                     }
                     CRCPosVal &amp;= 0xFF00;
                     crc[pos] = (unsigned char) (CRCPosVal &gt;&gt; 8);
             }
             free(CRC_Data);
     }

Read Checksum Algorithm
-----------------------

When the Xbox reads from the FACTORY\_SETTINGS or the USER\_SETTINGS
section of the EEPROM, this algorithm is ran over the entire section
accessed (including the CRC checksum mentioned above) to ensure that the
data is valid. If the result of the checksum algorithm does not equal
0xFFFFFFFF, STATUS\_DEVICE\_DATA\_ERROR is returned from the Kernel.

    static uint32_t eeprom_section_checksum(
        const uint32_t* section_data,
        uint32_t section_data_length
    )
    {
        const uint32_t bitmask = 0xFFFFFFFF;
        const uint32_t num_dwords = section_data_length >> 2;
        uint64_t checksum = 0;
        uint32_t carry_count = 0;

        for(uint32_t loop_count = num_dwords; loop_count > 0; loop_count--) {
