Dumping a BIOS can be done in several ways.

Using a chip reader
-------------------

The BIOS is an ordinary TSOP and can be read with an ordinary TSOP
reader.

Using a softmod exploit
-----------------------

Using a softmod exploit, you can usually choose to 'backup' your Xbox.
This dumps a load of information to E:\\Backup, including the BIOS. You
can then FTP into your Xbox and retrieve it.
