RtlExtendedLargeIntegerDivide will call RtlRaiseStatus(STATUS_INTEGER_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO) if Divisor = 0. Otherwise, a custom binary division algorithm is used to perform the divide operation. The algorithm below was reverse engineered from original hardware.

LARGE_INTEGER quotient = Dividend;
ULONG local_remainder = 0;
BOOLEAN carry, remainder_carry;

for (uint8_t i = 64; i > 0; i--) {
    carry = (quotient.QuadPart >> 63) & 0x1;
    remainder_carry = (local_remainder >> 31) & 0x1;
    quotient.QuadPart <<= 1;
    local_remainder = (local_remainder << 1) | carry;
    if (remainder_carry || (local_remainder >= Divisor)) {
        quotient.u.LowPart += 1;
        local_remainder -= Divisor;
    }
}
if (Remainder) {
    *Remainder = local_remainder;
}
