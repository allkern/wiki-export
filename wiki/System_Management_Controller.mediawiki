The System Management Controller (SMC) is a PIC16LC63A-04/SO microcontroller which handles a variety of tasks on the Xbox.
This includes rebooting the system, returning the connected kind of video cable, the DVD tray state, controlling the fan, LED control and sensing temperature.
It is also the hardware which is connected to the Power and Eject buttons.
The PIC is running at 20 MHz with its own ROM, RAM and I/O lines.

The PIC is always running, even if the Xbox is turned off. When the power cable is unplugged, it gets its energy from a capacitor for some hours. 

It is connected via IÂ²C and located on address 0x10.
