==== Skinning code / Shader rounding mode ====

This game depends on correct GPU rounding. If an emulator suffers from issues with non-exact rounding in the shaders which do the skinning / skeletal animation the character models will be very broken.

IIRC Code is like:

 A0 = c[113].x + c[113].z = 18
 *do stuff with c[96+A0] to c[98+A0]*
 
 A0 = c[113].x + c[113].z = 21
 *do stuff with c[96+A0] to c[98+A0]* 
 
 A0 = c[113].y * v2
 *do stuff with c[96+A0] to c[98+A0]*
 
 c[113] is vec4(15, 765, 3, 0). 765 = 3*255.
 v2 is GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, normalized => v2 = raw/255.
 A0 = 765 * raw/255 = 3*raw.

This should all be working, but it's not. [[NV2A/Vertex Shader]] does round-to-zero. Behaviour for GLSL and other modern graphic APIs is undefined..
To work around this rounding issue <code>A0 += 1.0/255.0</code> can be used as a temporary hack
