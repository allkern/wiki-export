USB Adapters

The Xbox input devices are USB devices. As such, you can connect a
keyboard to the Xbox, or a gamepad to your PC. In fact, Linux already
has drivers for the gamepad. In order to preserve Xbox hardware, please
do not cut OEM Xbox cables to make an adapter. Decent adapters can be
acquired cheaply (~$10 USD ea. on 2017.04.30).
