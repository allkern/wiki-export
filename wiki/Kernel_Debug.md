Only enabled in debug kernels, a Xbox with serial port can be kernel
debugged with windbg. only executables that have debugging switched on
can be debugged over serial aswell(?) {FIXME| Explain with more details
;) }

Xqemu emulates this serial port, wich uses a \[\[Super\_I/O | LPC chip
\].

{FIXME| some example kernel output}
