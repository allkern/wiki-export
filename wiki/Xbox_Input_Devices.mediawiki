== USB Adapters ==
The Xbox input devices are USB devices. As such, you can connect a keyboard to the Xbox, or a gamepad to your PC. In fact, Linux already has drivers for the gamepad. In order to preserve Xbox hardware, please do not cut OEM Xbox cables to make an adapter. Decent adapters can be acquired cheaply (~$10 USD ea. on 2017.04.30).
