The Super I/O board is a feature of [[Development Kits]]. The board is build around a SMSC LPC47M157 chip. A datasheet for a close relative can be found at http://datasheet.seekic.com/PdfFile/LPC/LPC47M140NC_SMSC_SMSC_Corporation.pdf (a working link seems to be: http://pdf-file.ic37.com/pdf1/SMSC/LPC47M140_datasheet_138298/225601/LPC47M140_datasheet.pdf)

The board provides the following ports:
* RS232 (used for [[Kernel Debug | Kernel debugging]], not the same as [[Xbox Debug Monitor]])

unpopulated ports or functions are:
* PS2 mouse and keyboard{{citation needed}}
