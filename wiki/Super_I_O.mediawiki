The Super I/O board is a feature of [[Development Kits]]. The board is build around a SMSC LPC47M157 chip ([https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0BxOesalXbGtOanoxenlqQUh6Y0k Datasheet])

The board provides the following ports:
* RS232 (used for [[Kernel Debug | Kernel debugging]], not to be confused with [[Xbox Debug Monitor]])

unpopulated ports or functions are:
* PS/2 Mouse port{{citation needed}}
* PS/2 Keyboard port{{citation needed}}
* something MCPX (SMBus?){{citation needed}}
* Temp something (SMBus?){{citation needed}}
* Post code (SMBus?){{citation needed}}
* Flash-ROM / BIOS (like modchips, replaces onboard kernel?){{citation needed}}

== Schematic ==
Its a four layer board, layers 2 and 3 are filled on the entire board, probably ground and power planes.
north, or up in the next tables is up as written the layer numbers and silkscreen common direction.
The folowing main parts are populated on the board:

The connections in the following tables are checked with the continuity test on a VOM(Multimeter).
