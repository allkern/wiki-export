The Super I/O board is a feature of some [[Development Kits]]. The board is build around a SMSC LPC47M157 chip ([https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0BxOesalXbGtOanoxenlqQUh6Y0k Datasheet]) and interfaces with the Xbox via a ribbon cable connected to the [[LPC Debug Port]].

The board provides the following ports:
* RS232 (used for [[Kernel Debug | Kernel debugging]], not to be confused with [[Xbox Debug Monitor]])

unpopulated ports or functions are:
* PS/2 Mouse port{{citation needed}}
* PS/2 Keyboard port{{citation needed}}
* something MCPX (SMBus?){{citation needed}}
* Temp something (SMBus?){{citation needed}}
* Post code (SMBus?){{citation needed}}
* Flash-ROM / BIOS (like modchips, replaces onboard kernel?){{citation needed}}

== Schematic ==
Its a four layer board, layers 2 and 3 are filled on the entire board, probably ground and power planes.
north, or up in the next tables is up as written the layer numbers and silkscreen common direction.
The folowing main parts are populated on the board:

NOTE: version 1.3+ motherboards are missing the LFRAME signal which will need to be generated by an external CPLD [https://www.reddit.com/r/originalxbox/comments/7uo3lq/got_an_xbox_for_free_dvd_tray_wont_stop_ejecting/dtmqmn3/]

NOTE: version 1.5 motherboards are missing pins 2 (GND) and 9 (VCC3), and pins 12 (GND) and 15 (VCC3) haven't been confirmed to work correctly{{citation needed}}
