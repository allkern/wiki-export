The CPU in the Xbox was a custom Pentium 3 running at 733MHz. The
'custom' part of this was that that the Pentium 3 in the Xbox was that
it had only 128KB L2 cache instead of the usual 256KB. This allowed
Microsoft to buy them at a bit of a discount and Intel to shift a few
more CPUs.

    differences are pin compatible.
