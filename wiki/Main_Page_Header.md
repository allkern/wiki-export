Welcome to XboxDevWiki.net,

</div>
<div style="font-size: 95%">
a wiki dedicated to research of the original Microsoft Xbox.

</div>
<div style="text-align:left;">
<hr>
This is an effort to document the inner workings of the original
Microsoft Xbox and Xbox-based SEGA Chihiro. We not only care about
technical details about those platforms, but also how to develop
homebrew and emulate them.

We are not interested in documenting the Xbox 360, Xbox One or any other
console at this point.

<hr>
This wiki was started by xqemu (Xbox emulator) authors. It will become
the place for all remaining Xbox projects to come together. If you are
interested in helping or discussing this, please come chat with us in
\#xqemu on freenode or Cxbx-Reloaded/Lobby on gitter.im.
