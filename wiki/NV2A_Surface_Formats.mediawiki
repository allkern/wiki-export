== Texture formats ==

* [http://download.nvidia.com/developer/OpenGL_Texture_Formats/nv_ogl_texture_formats.pdf List of implemented texture formats, according to NVIDIA]

=== Texture decoding / sampling ===

The textures are sampled by the texture shader portion of [[NV2A/Pixel_Combiner]].

==== Texture signedness ====

Each component of the texture can be either signed (two's-complement) or unsigned.[https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu/issues/75]{{FIXME|reason=Research and collect information here}}.

==== Texture filtering ====

The GPU implements the standard texture filters as known from OpenGL.
In addition, it supports convolution filters[https://github.com/xqemu/xqemu/issues/238]{{FIXME|reason=Research and collect information here}}.
