This article documents the attribute types which are supported by the Xbox GPU.

=== Normalized unsigned Byte (D3D) === 

Unsigned bytes aranged as ZYXW (BGRA) in memory (Also see [http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/vertex_array_bgra.txt this GL extension]).
This is commonly used with an attribute count of 4.
FIXME: Does this still work with attribute count =/= 4 ?
Each byte will be mapped into the range 0.0 to 1.0.
FIXME: Verify

=== Normalized unsigned Byte (GL) ===

Unsigned bytes arranged as XYZW (RGBA) in memory.
Each byte will be mapped into the range 0.0 to 1.0.
FIXME: Verify

=== Normalized short ===

Shorts, arranged as XYZW.
Each short will be mapped into the range -1.0 to 1.0
FIXME: Verify

=== Float ===

IEEE-754 single precision float arranged as XYZW.
FIXME: What happens to NaN or denormals?

=== Short ===

Shorts, arranged as XYZW.
Each short will be mapped into the range -32768.0 to 32767.0
FIXME: Verify

=== Compressed normal ===

Each 32 bit attribute is consisting of 11 bit X, 11 bit Y, 10 bit Z.
Each component is signed and will be mapped into the range -1.0 to 1.0.
FIXME: Verify
FIXME: Is the attribute count ignored?
