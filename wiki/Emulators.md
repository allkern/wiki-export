Said to be working similar to the 360 support in the Xbox One [20](https://youtu.be/x0NKP7-h_G0?t=8503). The 360 support is probably ahead of time shader translation and runtime CPU translation [21](https://majornelson.com/podcast/584-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-turns-1/).                                                                      |
