The Xbox implements https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/vertex_program.txt and https://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/NV/vertex_program1_1.txt
This article will mainly focus on actual encoding on hardware as the behaviour is mostly outlined in those GL extensions already.

== Operating modes ==

* Fixed / Programmable
* Writeable / Read-Only constants
* Low-constants only / all constants
* Vertex processing / State program

== Registers ==

* 16 input registers v[0] to v[15] (from vertex, v[0] is fed from LAUNCH_DATA for VSPs)
* output registers: o[0] to o[?] (initialized to XYZ=0x00000000 W=0x3F800000)
** Following indices are aliased: Pos, oD0, oD1, oFog, oPts, oB0, oB1, oT0, oT1, oT2, oT3
* 1 Address register: A0.x
* 12 temporary registers: R0 to R11 (initialized to XYZW=0x00000000)
** The POS register is mirrored as R12 so it can be used as source operand, so effectively you have 13 temporaries

=== Constant space ===

There are 192 constant registers in two seperate blocks with 96 constants each.
They can be accessed through the PGRAPH RDI: select=0x17. Each constant slot is 4x DWORD, ordered as WZYX.
Alternatively they can be uploaded through method [FIXME], with 4x DWORD, ordered XYZW.

== Instructions ==

In total, there are 136 instruction slots.

Each slot consists of 16 bytes, we consider those as 4 seperate little-endian DWORDS describing the operation. Word 0 is inused.
