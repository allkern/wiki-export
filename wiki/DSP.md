The DSPs in the APU are probably “Parthus MediaStream” DSP core
(DSP24210/DSP2420?).

Those are similar to Motorola DSP56362 (DSP56300 Family). If so, the
datasheet can be found at
<http://www.nxp.com/docs/en/data-sheet/DSP56362.pdf> (Also see
“Documentation” section in said datasheet for the related documentation)

According to espes, the DMA stuff is different.
